GPS

    Is the GPS problem solver implemented as a class or as a function?
    The solver requires initial states, goal states and operators. Of what type are these objects?
    Is the mechanism recursive? If so, how does it implement its recursion?

1. Function
2. Operator = dictionary
   Initial states = dictionary (list as a value)
   goal states = dictionary (list as a value)
3. No, it is not recursive (for loop goes through whole process)



Monkey

    What famous puzzle does this code model and what are the rules of that puzzle? Does the code faithfully implement the puzzle?
    What components does each domain action specify?
    How does the GPS mechanism solve the problem? Be prepared to specify this in detail. You can use the logging feature to print a trace of the mechanismâ€™s deliberations.
    Is this code artificially intelligent? If so, which definition (or definitions) of AI from the text does it satisfy?
    Would a monkey who/that solves the problem in the real world be displaying intelligence?

1. Monkey/Banana problem (hungry monkey is left in a room with banana just high enough for monkey that it needs to use both stool and stick to reach it). Sample program is missing a stick as a tool, but all others are faithfully implemented.
2. 
3. 
4. It satisfies "Thinking Rationally" definition of AI (made logical action based on precondition to achieve an end goal)
5. Yes, monkey made a rational decision based on the environment. It saw the banana, used the tools around it to make right choice, but it didn't know the outcome of its action in advance.
