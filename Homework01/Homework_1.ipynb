    "### Question 1\n",
    "Inspection: the examination of one's own conscious thoughts and feelings. In psychology, the process of introspection relies exclusively on observation of one's mental state, while in a spiritual context it may refer to the examination of one's soul. Introspection is closely related to human self-reflection and self-discovery and is contrasted with external observation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I believe that introspection would be a useful tool for developing more human-like AI. For many decades, AI researcher focused on the optimization and problem solving as a primary attribute of AI. However, despite AI can start to outperform human in various areas, it still does not reason like humans. In the distant future, researchers may be able to fully understand brain and replicate human conciousness. However, neuroscience is nowhere close to that point. Until that day comes, I believe that self-reflection (introspection) is the best tools we've got as a heuristics that AI researchers could use to emulate human conciousness and prevent AI from becoming too distanced from our goal.\n"

    "Hill-climbing is magnitude faster than Simulated-annealing when it comes to computational speed. However, Simulated-annealing does better job finding the shortest path, especially when the number of cities grew. For example, both HC and SA consistently got the same value for the city-size of 4. At the city-size of 8, SA got better result after many trials. For the city-size of 12, SA found better solution than HC once every few runs. I expect trends to continue as city-size grows, and at certain point SA would perform much better than HC as more and more local minima get introduced."
